Palette modules
---------------

This is a collection of small python modules defining color palettes, that can
be used with my config templates.

Selenized palettes are all defined parmetrically using a common python module
`selenized_base`.

There are also some other (non-selenized) palettes here, mainly for the purpose
of being able to try them and compare to selenized.
