 \e[33mYellow\e[0m is tricky, because we are used to it being bright.
 \e[32mGreen\e[0m, on the contrary, is quite simple.
 \e[36mCyan\e[0m also has to be dimmer than what we are used to.
 \e[34mBlue\e[0m must be darker than cyan to make them clearly ${BRIGHT}different.${RESET}
 \e[35mMagenta\e[0m is quite simple again.
