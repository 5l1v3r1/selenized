 \e[31mRed\e[0m cannot be too bright, because it would get desaturated.
 \e[33mYellow\e[0m is tricky, because we are used to it being bright.
 \e[32mGreen\e[0m, on the contrary, is quite simple.
 \e[36mCyan\e[0m also has to be dimmer than what we are used to.
 \e[34mBlue\e[0m must be darker than cyan to make them clearly different.
 \e[35mMagenta\e[0m is quite simple again.
