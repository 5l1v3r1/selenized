Selenized color scheme
----------------------

This is a color scheme I use with my terminal.  It has moderate brightness and
medium foreground/background contrast to reduce eye strain, but at the same
time it uses quite saturated colors with contrasting hues for unambiguous 
syntax highlighting.

This is very much work in progress.  Expect the colors to change (albeit not
very much); I also plan to add a dark-on-light version and configuration files
for other terminal emulators (and possibly also other programs).
