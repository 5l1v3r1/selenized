Terminal.app (OS X default terminal)
------------------------------------

**Don't use OS X default terminal!**

Using Selenized with OS X default terminal is problematic. That's because
Terminal.app has a misfeature: it will modify the colors you set in preferences
according to its own liking, and you cannot disable this behaviour - see [this
StackExchange post](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/29487/172274).  There are
[workarounds](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/43679/172274), but according to
[some people](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/216159/172274) they may not be
reliable.

Therefore I strongly recommend that Mac users switch to
[iTerm](http://www.iterm2.com/), which seems to be a much better terminal
emulator anyway. You can find Selenized color palette for iTerm
[here](../iterm/).
